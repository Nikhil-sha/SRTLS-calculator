# Success Percentage Calculator

## Overview
The **Success Percentage Calculator** is a tool that estimates the potential success based on five key parameters: skill, resources, time/age, luck, and support. The calculator provides a success percentage based on the input values for each parameter.

## Parameters

1. **Skill Percentage**: The level of expertise or competence. 
2. **Resource Percentage**: The amount and quality of resources (funds, tools, manpower, etc.) available to you.
3. **Time/Age**: Just your age.
4. **Luck Percentage**: The external factors or randomness that may influence success beyond your control (means how lucky you think you are?).
5. **Support Percentage**: The backing or help you have from others (mentors, team, family, network, etc.).
